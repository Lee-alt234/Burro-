one of the staff, amjad asked if he can hold our infant son so that we could dine in peace and that was the biggest thing anyone could do for a family with an infant. our servers luv and myron were equally amazing. since our dinners were usually late (when buffet would almost be closing), we were offered a few things from the buffet as complementary along with our a la carte order. really appreciate that the restaurant does not waste food or resues it the next day. their dessert bar is out of the world! what we loved: 1. aloo mattar kebab 2. malai ice-cream 3. gulab jamun 4. kadai paneer 5. dal tadka 6. dragon potatoes overall worthy of 5 star and chef's kiss! we just went to grab a couple of beers, but we tried their veg hara bhara kebab, and it was the best that we have ever had. meenaxi, a charming young lady, welcomed us with a big smile. the buffet was also available, but we didn't go for it. aman, our servant, was a great guy who made sure that our dining experience is up to the mark. the buffet breakfast at planet hollywood was served at the restaurant called planet dailies and had a very good vegetarian spread with lots of eggless desserts as well! we liked the breakfast all 3 days! what we loved the most in the breakfast spread was the south indian food- idli, mix veg dosa, chilli cheese uttapam, the kachoris were super yum, poha, paneer paratha (must try) and the dessert counter with fresh cakes, donuts and muffins! if you are a coffee lover go for the double shot cappuccino with the pancakes and waffles , you will definitely enjoy it :) what we did not like was consistency in taste for dosas and uttapams and few other dishes like chole kulche which were not upto the mark. the staff was super friendly and helpful and prompt on service.hope we all get to travel soon to enjoy the favourite part of the vacation \ud83d\ude1c!

  "oito european-goan fusion restaurant in panjim. indoor seating full bar available insta-worthy spots top rated instagrammable photogenic picturesque aesthetic cost for two is \u20b92500. luxurious very expensive posh food and service was amazing, it was a tuesday night so a light night. quality of food and the cocktails were top notch. ryan made it a point to visit the guests and ensure everything was in order. i spent last sunday at oito, nestled in the peaceful residential neighbourhood of caranzalem, and it was easily one of the most enjoyable brunch experiences i\u2019ve had in goa. the restaurant spans two levels, with clean, minimal interiors that let the food shine. i opted for a few vegetarian and egg-based dishes and was genuinely impressed. the saut\u00e9ed exotic mushroom toast was deeply flavourful, and the soft scrambled eggs melted perfectly into their in-house sourdough, which was toasted just right. the oito cilbir, a poached egg over garlic-infused yoghurt, finished with chilli crunch and dill \u2014 completely changed my mind about the dish. it was soft, tangy, herby, and had a beautiful kick of spice. i also tried the flame-grilled chicken skewers with koji miso. while i appreciated the unique flavour profile, i found the texture a little dry for my liking. that said, these were just part of their small plates and by the end of them, we were surprisingly full. the true star for me was their hummus & pita. i\u2019m usually not a fan of chickpeas, but this version, topped with caramelised onions, pickled vegetables, crispy chickpeas, and crumbled feta was absolutely addictive. every bite worked beautifully. one detail that stood out to me was the pita served alongside the hummus. it was topped with za'atar, adding a lovely depth of spice and aroma. interestingly, its texture and appearance bore a strong resemblance to our local poee, which added a delightful sense of familiarity. this fusion felt intentional and well-executed. they do offer a wide range of dishes, and here are a few i\u2019d recommend trying on your visit: the chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, oito carbonara, and crab cake benni. oito also goes beyond basics at the bar. the lychee rhododendron fizz and melon mint sparkler were floral, fizzy, and wonderfully refreshing. a big shoutout to mayur, who gracefully walked us through the menu, the vision behind oito and helped with thoughtful suggestions. brunch runs from 12pm to 3:30pm, with live music that adds the perfect laid-back vibe. and while hummus is traditionally middle eastern, it has earned its place on many modern european menus and oito\u2019s version is a standout. definitely a must-visit for a flavour-packed, slow sunday in goa. oito is honestly one of the most exciting dining spots i\u2019ve been to in a while! the vibe is so inviting - the bar is a showstopper, curling up to the ceiling with bottles that sparkle, and the open kitchen adds such a warm, bustling energy. the blue crab mural on the wall gave it a playful goan touch, and the two-floor setup made it feel both intimate and grand, perfect for soaking in every moment. the menu was a revelation - european comfort food elevated with fresh local seafood that had me hooked from the first bite! seeing a restaurant like oito deliver such incredible fare with so much heart has me over the moon. i can\u2019t wait to go back for more - especially since i didn't even get to main course here! those small plates were divine! definitely try the eggs benny with crab cakes, the hummus, beef carpaccio and creme brulee as well as the panna cotta. such a charming bistro-bar in the heart of panjim! oito is the brainchild of chef viraf, who\u2019s a well known name in the culinary world. he brings his expertise to goa and boy are we glad he chose panjim for his new venture. the food is bursting with flavours and the mixology is on point. attentive servers know their recommendations and service is top notch. loved the rockefeller crab, mushroom ajilo and the veg lasagna (for once i enjoyed the veg as much as the fish and poultry) desserts were fabulous too! we devoured the chocolate orange cake and matcha misu cake. if you haven\u2019t been to oito, i suggest you do so post-haste! we had an amazing and a real gastronomical experience at oito!!everything what we ordered was excellent!!th crab cakes and the waldorf salad were exceptionally good!we had so many starters that we coukd not order the mains\u2026.so next time shall visit again to try the mains!!the service was very goid and melvin saw that we didnt lack anything .the owner and chef mrviraf patel was there all the time checking if we were satisfied or not!!we wish him and team oito all the very best !!oneards and upwards only. ada chicken add bacon burgers basil crusted chonak; caper butter sauce; lemon rice buttcr poachcd prawns; lettuce, picklcd crab calamari; prawns; musscls cheddar cheese; bacon; honey mustard cheese; lettuce, tomato; pesto classic carbonara with risotto, poached egg cooked on an irori grill; pilaf rice cucumber; caesar dressing egg; eldalle fish fisherman\"s fish, veggies. dill fries; sweet potato chips, green salad, gourmet sandwiches grilled chicken with pilaf rice goan red rice grccn musck veggics grilled chicken leg slices; lettuce, tomato, kingfisher ultra lump crab mcat made caesar dressing mexican spice marinated chicken minced chicken patty lettuce; grilled mozzarella cheese, hot sauce mayo onion; cheddar cheese, fried egg, chilli prawn ajille pulled pork sandwich prawns evoo, prawns; purple risotto with chicken meatballs sauteed tenderloin style rice with tiger sun-dried fish crisp tenderloin burger tenderloin, whole crab icoo",

  "zubins parsi food indian , parsi restaurant in assagao. family-friendly outdoor seating top rated cost for two is \u20b91500. premium expensive fine dining zubin's parsi food and more is the quintessential mom-and-pop restaurant offering what is arguably the most authentic parsi cuisine in goa. from the moment you step in, you are transported into a warm, homely environment where food isn't just prepared \u2014 it's crafted with love, tradition, and care. for the uninitiated or not as fortunate as mentioned to have a parsi spouse (well half parsi but that makes no difference when it comes to food) ,parsi cuisine is a beautiful blend of persian roots and indian influences, reflecting the community's migration history. it is known for its slow-cooked dishes, rich in layered flavors and textures. signature ingredients like dried fruits, nuts, and spices like cumin, coriander, and cinnamon play a central role, creating a balance of sweet, sour, and savory notes. chef zubin\u2019s passion and culinary heritage shine through every dish. his mastery of traditional recipes is evident in the perfectly cooked fish, prawns, mutton, and chicken \u2014 tender, juicy, and never overcooked or chewy. his wife, mani, complements the experience with her heartwarming customer service. her stories and warm interactions make you feel like a cherished guest in a traditional parsi home, where hospitality is second nature. mani is so charming that even if the food was bad i would still give this place a 5 star rating. i would not be able to sleep at night knowing i gave her restaurant anything less than a 5 star rating after all the fun and laughter she shared with us. zubin is committed to authenticity . even the sides, from salli (crispy potato straws which he sources from outside goa) to fresh salads and sweet-tangy chutneys, are so good they can be enjoyed on their own, yet they perfectly enhance the main courses. the spice levels at parsi food are milder compared to goan or mughlai cuisines. this makes the dishes lighter yet incredibly flavorful. this balance however is deceptive \u2014 i found myself overeating on all three visits! the food here is delicious and despite not remembering the names of all the dishes, the taste remains unforgettable. (i rely on my wife to provide the names when i need them). their desserts i.e. the caramel custard, bread pudding, and the indulgent lagan nu custard, are a must try. after overeating the main course on my last visit, i still couldn't resist eating the latter two together. yes, i overate every time i visited because of which i had to go to church the following sunday, confess and seek forgiveness from god for indulging in the sin of gluttony. since many parsi dishes are time-intensive, we placed our order a day in advance for more variety \u2014 a recommendation i\u2019d strongly suggest. while parsi food is labor-intensive and priced higher than typical indian cuisines, the experience at zubin's is worth every rupee. i have eaten at a famous parsi restaurant in mumbai and i do have a fair benchmark of restaurant parsi cuisine. this place is better. final thoughts - it\u2019s been nine months since i first visited this place( that\u2019s also how long i\u2019ve procrastinated writing this review). but after visiting this place thrice, i can definitely guarantee that they are consistent with the quality of food they serve. this place is highly recommended for anyone who loves parsi food or wants to experience what a unique blend of heritage, authenticity, passion, and love tastes like on a plate. it\u2019s a dining experience that leaves you craving more or atleast parcel a portion or two to take home for dinner. highly recommended! zubins is a delightful haven for those seeking an authentic taste of parsi cuisine. from the moment you step inside, you're transported to a warm, inviting ambiance. the menu is a treasure trove of parsi delicacies, each dish a testament to the community's rich culinary heritage. the sali boti was standout, the tender, succulent meat paired with crisp potato straws, a truly iconic parsi dish. we tried chicken panko, chicken sali, chicken cutlet and prawns pulao. the hosts zubin and mani are very friendly and connect easily, creating lasting memories. the quality of the food and the unique dining experience make it worth every penny. zubins is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates fine dining and wants to explore the vibrant flavors of parsi culture. what a delight it was to come to this lovely, cozy place! i can\u2019t decide what i found better: the delicious, home-cooked, authentic parsi meal or the lovely hosts that made every minute of our time there beautiful! it didn\u2019t feel like we were meeting them for the first time, it felt like we were back at home with family, eating an unforgettable meal. we\u2019ve been to many places in goa, but we haven\u2019t yet come across a place as real that focuses on serving guests a delightful culinary experience and delivers one magnificently, too! we\u2019ve spent so many months looking for that touch of home in food for so long here, and now that we\u2019ve found it, we can\u2019t wait to devour their entire menu. thank you mani and zubin for this amazing experience, we\u2019re still raving about the food! we recently had lunch at zubins and were treated to an authentic parsi feast. from the moment we walked in, the warm hospitality and inviting ambiance set the tone for a great meal. the portion sizes were generous, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. overall, a fantastic experience that we\u2019d highly recommend to anyone looking to explore traditional parsi flavors!
